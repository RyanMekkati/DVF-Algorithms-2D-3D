# DVF-Algorithms-2D-3D

A motion detection algorithm in C++ that takes in input sequences of png files and shows the DVF of the sequence.

A few methods are used to be compared ultimately:

1. Optical flow (Horn & Schnuck)
Non diffeomorphic DVF  

2. LDDMM
Very elegant method that uses principles of diffeomorphisms, Lie groups and Lie algebras.



This was an introduction to my thesis on adaptive radiotherapy and detection motion of mobile tumors by combining deep learning with stochastocial proccesses, differential geometry and topology. Some results are also presented for the different methods
