# Motion-Detection-w-Horn-Schnuck
A motion detection algorithm in C++ that takes in input mp4 files and shows the vector field of optical flow. We used OpenCV which was usefull for treating mp4 files frame by frame which are actually compressed and to design the mesh in which we presented the optical flow vecttor field.

This was an introduction to my future thesis on adaptive radiotherapy and detection motion of mobile tumors by combining deep learning with stochastocial proccesses, differential geometry and topology. I show in my result paper how it does for some moving objects like a classical rotating sphere around it's center of mass and a lung cancer during fluoroscopy.
